# Interview preparation

## Agile and Scrum potential interview questions
**What is Agile?**

Agile is essentially a methodology of delivering a product, which ensures fast, accurate and continuous delivery.
It has 4 values to go by:
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change over following a plan

**What is Scrum?**

Scrum is a framework used to deliver the Agile methodology.
- It involves (artifacts)- product backlog, sprint backlog, burn-down sprint chart, and increments.
- Implemented using (ceremonies)- Sprint planning, Daily scrum, Sprint review, Sprint retrospective.

**What is the difference between agile and scrum?**
- Scrum is a framework used to deliver the Agile methodology.

**What are the 3 amigos?**
- Buisness - What problem are we trying to solve?
- Development - How might we build a solution to that problem?
- Testing - What might happen?

**Persona?**

A persona is used to develop a deeper awareness of the users of the end product. It is a detailed real/hypothetical descripetion of a typical end user of the product the team is developing. It can help improve the value and integrity of the final product, as it helps determine what to include.

**What are Scrum roles, Artifacts, Event roles, Sprint?**

The scrum roles include:
- Product owner (in charge of product backlog)
- Scrum master (coach to development team and helps realise user stories)
- Development team (do the work to deliver each increment)
The Artifacts of scrum as described before are the main stages that make up a scrum framework.
Event Roles: The sprint planning requires all 3 scrum roles; the daily scrum involves only the development team (others can attend); the sprint review is attended by the entire scrum team, along with any stakeholders and senior managers (diverse feedback essential); sprint retrospect focus on the process, and involve the entire scrum team (product owner optional).
The development of the product is broken down into increments. A sprint is a process undergone to realise each increment. It typically lasts no more than a month. A new sprint is started after the completion of the previous sprint.

**V-Model, Agile, Waterfall - difference between them and use cases?**

V - model and waterfall each dont start a next phase untill the previous one is completed, and end with a completed product. Agile develops a minimal viable product, and iterates on that product to improve it.
The difference between V-model and waterfall, is that each stage is tested as its completed, where as the waterfall method only allows for testing after the development activities are completed.
Use Cases:
- Waterfall
  - S - Projects where the functionality cannot be delivered in pieces
  - T - Need to deliver a product that doesnt need updates
  - A - Use waterfall to deliver a well defined completed and tested products
  - R - Product produced not needing updates
- V-method
  - S - Product well defined, with clear design specifications, strict deadline
  - T - Produce the finished product in time and accurately
  - A - V-model implemented to complete the process, with validation and verification of each stage done once completed
  - R - Product delivered on time with testing done to ensure a completed product.
- Agile 
  - S - The customer needs cannot be defined upfront
  - T - Need to deliver a product and work out customer needs from there
  - A - Agile method implemented
  - R - First product produced quickly, customer needs better defined, product keeps getting updated as customer needs better defined

**Restrospective, Starfish Retrospective, Root cause?**

In terms of Scrum, the sprint retrospective focusses on the improvement of the processes carried out in that sprint. Different to the sprint review, which focusses on the product produced. 
The starfish retrospective defines 5 clear points to focus on in the retrospective:
  - What to start doing
  - What to stop doing
  - What to keep doing
  - What to do more of
  - What to do less of

Root cause analysis is the technique used by project managers and all professionals to spot the challenges a program should tackle to meet its target. The reason it is important is that the visible aspects of a specific issue might not be the root cause, and wou will need to dig deeper to find the problems contributing to this issue, and find their root cause.

## SQL potential interview questions
**What is a foreign key?**

A primary key is a column that uniquely identifies every row in the table. A foreign key is used to link two tables. The foreign key of one table is the primary key of the table it is linked to.

**What is DML, DDL, DCL and TCL?**

SQL commands are divided into 4 subgroups.
- DML - Data Manipulation Language
  - SELECT
  - INSERT
  - UPDATE
  - DELETE
  - MERGE
  - CALL
  - EXPLAIN PLAN
  - LOCK TABLE
- DDL - Data Definition Language
  - CREATE
  - ALTER
  - DROP
  - TRUNCATE
  - COMMENT
  - RENAME
- DCL - Data Control Language
  - GRANT
  - REVOKE
- TCL - Transaction Control Language
  - COMMIT
  - ROLLBACK
  - SAVEPOINT
  - SET TRANSACTION

## Python interview questions
**What is OOP and four pillars?**

OOP stands for object oriented programming. OOP can take its form in many ways such as the use of classes and objects but the 4 pillars define it:
- Abstraction (Only showing whats relavent, and omit unecessary details)
- Polymorphism (Methods receives paramters that handles many types)
- Inheretence (Code shared through inheriting classes functionality)
- Encapsulation (Encapture functionality and data within objects)

**Example of when you implemented OOP?**

- S - Learning Python in my free time I set myself a project.
- T - This was to build a simple blackjack game.
- A - I created Classes for the bank, the player and the hand, and used the 4 pillars of OOP to guide the creation of these task with the final goal in mind. Each of these classes held abstract functionalities later specified in my code to create the blackjack game.
- R - The game worked, and the code was easy to follow and understand due to the use of classes.

**What is TDD & how we used it?**

TDD stands for Test Driven Development. It is the methodology that focusses on making tests, writing code that passes those tests, then modifying the tests to build working software.

## DevOps interview questions
**What is DevOps?**

Devops links the development and operations teams, process and technology to continually provide value to customers. To have the enable speed and accuracy of delivering a product through:
- Continuous intergration and continuous delivery
- Version control
- Agile software development
- Infrastructure as code
- Configuration management
- Continuous monitoring

It is best practise for bringing teams together, making them share responsibility, producing infrastructure as code, and automating processes. This CI/CD of the product will allow faster time to market, better team work ethic, automated scalable environments, continuous release cycles, and increased quality of product (constent testing).

**Why use DevOps?**

- S - Development team and Operations team worked in separate silos with poor communication between teams
- T - To improve the collaboration between teams, speed of product delivery, and customer satisfaction.
- A - To impliment a DevOps culture, tools and practices
- R - DevOps enables higher productivity and communication between teams improved. Continuous delivery of Software using agile methodologies meaning the Buisness is also able to adapt to the market and competition quicker and easier.

**Why did you choose DevOps?**

- A career in tech INTRIGUED me
  - coding modules
  - learned python having graduated
  - DevOps specifically, the idea of working in a team to optimise software delivery plays to my strengths
    - ACTIVE team player
    - PROFICIENT Problem solving ability
    - New software comes out, keen fast learner
- Idea of Automating a long process really excites me. 

**Elavators Pitch?**

## Cloud and Microservices
**Whats a VPC?**
- segregated cloud for infrastructure.
- NACL - SG - Subnets - IGW - Routes - Instances

**Whats Networking?**
- Mapping of the communication between computors.
- done with IP addresses and ports for different requests.

**Difference between VM and Containers?**
- Containers share resources with the OS, this helps them be more lightweight and therefore faster to startup.
- VM is for creating similar development, testing and production environments. 
- Containers are for segregating different software into its own environment, that make them widely available and easily deployable.

**AWS S3**
- Provides data readily available on the cloud.
- Used for desaster recovery plan
- goes to glacier automatically after long time of no use
- cost effective
